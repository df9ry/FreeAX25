FreeAX25
========

Release 0.0.1 as of 2015-05-19, DF9RY - Tania (Tania@DF9RY.de)

Flexible Packet Radio system that runs in the user space and don't
rely on the AX.25 kernel implementation. This program is written in
conventional C++11 and avoids system dependencies when possible.

This project is the successor of project OpenAX25 that is hosted on
Sourceforge: <...>. With this new project I try to avoid a couple of
design flaws I learnt with OpenAX25.

The project has been renamed to FreeAX25 to emphasize the freedom of
the users and of subsequent developers to provide the ham radio
community with a true free and open source code basis for their own
experiments and developments.
